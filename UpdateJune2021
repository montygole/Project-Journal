As I'm doing academic research on Linux's Kernel community I have begun learning kernel development(cuz why not)

I am also learning calculus and can't beleive how many questions I've pondered in the past can be answered with this super useful mathematical tool! For example, when I am driving I always think about a radar gun works for cops. Sure they could just take my position at 2 locations on the road and then see how quickly it took me to travel said distance. But I always thought how they could be more accurate, I could be going 30km/h for a part of the distance they measure then accelerate to 100km/h before the distance they measure ends. Or I could do the same thing but decellaerate instead. The answer to higher accuracy is the derivative!! Along some interval, my speed can be calculated at any point! UGH CALCULUS IS SO COOL!

I'm currently learning parametric equations and L'Hopitals rule as I write this. I can't beleive I didn't take math in HS, I'm glad I have discovered a new passion of mine!
