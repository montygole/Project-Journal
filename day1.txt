Hi this is the first day of this stuff: 3/1/2021

Making a Webserver:

ALSO LEARNING GIT SOOO

First of all, I know that I must implement a DMZ(great name) into my setup. This is so external access can only get to my webserver, not my precious bank info

So this is a cool page for DMZ info: https://www.axigen.com/articles/how-to-install-a-demilitarized-zone-for-your-servers_24.html

So something I'm weary about is the security(hence me beginning with the DMZ)

Gonna be learning more about that before I make anything public

There's a very good diagram provided on the site above which descirbe
DMZ(three-legged and back-to-back models) in an
abstract manner(like everything in networking lol)

Here's my freehand ASCII rendition of said diagrad:

I WOULD NEVER TRY THAT...CMON I'M NOT A RENNAISANCE MAN(YET?)!!

I am now learning to set up NGINX(ENGINE X)

This site is my first resource: https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-nginx-on-debian-9/


It ended up being hell for me to figure out where to put my conf & files I want
to show on the site.

Turns out it was in the nginx.conf file the entire time(in an include statement)

So now I just have a static html file on the server

Now I am going to check what else I can to security wise:
