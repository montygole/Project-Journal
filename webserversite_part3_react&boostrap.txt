UPDATE: I have begun hosting a site, montydev.xyz!

My plans: create a site that is a hub of my computer endeavors! It will include an about me page, my work experience, projects, my github, and some games made in REACT!

Now to create a frontend with bootstrap!


I've copied the CDN, and am beginning to make it.

Updates will follow.

I'm thinking of either using basic monochrome, or material design colours.
